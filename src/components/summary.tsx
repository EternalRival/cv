        I became interested in programming in July 2020 as a hobby. Learned some basics on my own, developed an app
        called IQTestRPM (Raven's Progressive Matrices), released it on Google Play (1.5k installs and 4.54â˜…). When the
        app's download count started to go up, I realized that I enjoy creating apps that people use. For a while, I
        abandoned the hobby for personal reasons. Later came back to development, started learning JS on my own, and
        then the rest of the technology frontend stack (and a bit of the backend). Completed JS, Node and React courses
        at RSSchool (courses from EPAM), participated in team projects and still volunteer there, helping newcomers with
        various issues. {/* I am offering myself for the position of Frontend Software Developer at a cost of 1400$ */}
